            <p>
                I was born in Israel, and lived in Rehovot with my parents for the first few years of my childhood.
                At the age of five, my father had to be relocated to California for work, and so I moved for the first
                time. Initially, going to elementary school was tough, as I was unfamiliar with American culture,
                policies, and only knew Hebrew. However, with time I quickly resolved these issues. By the end of
                fifth grade, I had plenty of friends, knew English better than Hebrew, and graduated from elementary
                school. However, at the same time, my dad's work relocated him again. Thus, my family moved from
                California to Massachusetts, and I once again had to reengage in the culture and the community. This
                time however, I also had to learn to adapt to the weather, as the first time I saw snow was in
                Massachusetts. It was around this time that I also first developed an interest in computer science. In
                8th grade, I took a course on making games with Scratch, and the same summer I took a summer course in
                basic C++. However, it was in 11th grade when I really became engrossed in computer science. I took a
                semester long course on C++, and in 12th grade took AP Computer Science, an advanced year-long Java course.
                By the end of high school, I decided to pursue a degree in computer science, and am now doing so at
                Reichman University.

                Throughout my childhood, I've played mostly casually with friends and family. In high school, I played
                some competitive league-style tennis.</li>
                <li><b STYLE="font-size: 23px">Movies:</b> I love watching movies, alone and with others. I try to watch
                a new movie with friends at least once a week. My favorite genres are Fantasy and Horror, and my all-time
                favorite movies are Peter Jackson's 'Lord of the Rings'.</li>
                <li><b STYLE="font-size: 23px">Video Games:</b> Similarly to tennis, I've played video games for the majority
                of my life. Ever since my dad bought the household a PS3 when I was 8, I've played lots of games across every platform
                I could get my hands on. My favorite genre of video games is RPG Adventure games, and my all-time favorite
                video game is 'Dark Souls'.</li>
